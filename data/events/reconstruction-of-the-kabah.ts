		{
			"subtitle": "Prophetic Ḥadīth",
			"text": "O ʿĀ'ishah! Were it not that your people have recently left disbelief, I would have demolished the Kaʿbah and rebuilt it upon the foundations of Ibrāhīm, and I would have included the Hijr within it.",
			"source": "Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī (1586)",
			"details": "Arabs had concept of ḥalāl and ḥarām. They understood that whatever we earn by raiding each other's caravans/riba/prostituion, it is ḥarām. They rebuilt the Kaʿbah with only ḥalāl wealth. When running short of funds, they left out part of Ibrāhīm's original foundation, creating the semi-circular Hijr Ismāʿīl. Later, the Prophet ﷺ clarified that had it not been for Quraysh's closeness to Jāhiliyyah, otherwise he would have restored it to the original dimensions."

		"Hijr Ismāʿīl: Part of Ibrāhīm's foundations remained outside; praying there is equivalent to praying inside the Kaʿbah.",
		"Zayd ibn ʿAmr ibn Nufayl: He was an old man and he went out in the search of truth.",
		"Jew & Christian: Zayed tried Jew and Christianity but he did not find the truth. He said 'O Allah, be witness, I am upon the dīn of Ibrāhīm.' He publically called quraish towrds monotheism. Today I do not see anyone from you upon the religion of Ibrāhīm.",
		"Waraqah ibn Nawfal: A relative of Khadījah (RA), had mastered Hebrew and Aramaic and translated Jewish and Christian manuscripts into Arabic. He believed in the oneness of Allah (subḥānahu wa taʿāla) and was among those known as ḥanīfs, seekers of pure monotheism upon the way of Ibrāhīm (AS)."

		"Traces of tawḥīd remained in Arabia through individuals like Umayyah ibn Abī al-Ṣalt.",
		"He was from Ṭāʾif and he preached about Allah's oneness and recited poetry on tawḥīd",
		"The Prophet ﷺ admired his poetry but wished he had accepted Islam.",
		"Knowledge without submission led Umayyah to reject prophethood out of jealousy.",
		"His preaching meant that his people were not strangers to the idea of one God.",
